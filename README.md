# Reinforcement-Learning-Actor-Critic-Lunar-Lander
A reinforcement learning agent uses the actor-critic method to beat Atari's Lunar Lander. This implementation via a python notebook is set up to learn in 400 episodes with the agent exploring almost the entire time. This project was implemented per the requirements of the Reinforcement Learning Final Project rules.
